Killer series is a bunch of programs I made for personal use </br>
They only have a purpose, Kiling processes in one (or two) clics because I´m too lazy to open task manager and kill them manualy </br>
so I made this, I use them on windows start menu </br>
</br>
Important note: if you use one of this files your antivirus (or windows defender) may warn you not to open them </br>
this is because I dont have a Windows certificate (Don´t want to pay for it), so they´r marked as unsafe...</br>
anyways, files are totaly safe
